# Sample of NetLogo Models from CSS 645- Spatial Agent-based Models of Human-Environment Interactions 

**Description**: This course will introduce graduate students in the spatial, environmental, and computational social sciences to the use of agent-based techniques as a means of modeling human-environmental interactions. Emphasis will be placed on spatial processes, the use of spatial identifiers to link socioeconomic and biophysical models, and where possible, links to geographic information and associated technologies. We will cover applications in areas such as agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, habitat degradation, interactions between human populations and nonhuman species, urban models, and civil violence.

The course will combine literature review with some hands-on modeling. When demo versions are available, we will compile and run models as we review articles based on those models. In addition, students will complete a class project where they develop their own models in their areas of interest.

## Release Notes
Please note these models ***come as is***. Furthermore, no personal information is given on who created these models (unless there is a publication withit, but I need to acknowledge all the students who submitted the models, you know who you are! This project would not be possible without you!), What explanations there are given by the README file for each model (these mainly come in the form of abstracts from the papers that were submitted with the models). **No further explanations, support etc. will be given**. Lastly, these models are only given for pedagogical reasons and where possible each model has been upgraded to NetLogo 6.1.
