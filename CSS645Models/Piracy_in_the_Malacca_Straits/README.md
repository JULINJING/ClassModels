# Piracy in the Malacca Straits

## Abstract

"This project models maritime piracy activities in present-day, in the area of the Malacca Straits: a key maritime navigation corridor between Malaysia and Indonesia. The primary question this model addresses is the effect of increased piracy on a maritime security forceâ€™s ability to neutralize piracy against commercial cargo vessels.   Since this question involves differing behaviors of multiple actors, it makes it a candidate for Agent-based Modeling (ABM).  Additionally, the relative simplicity of the terrain (open water) means that a model can focus on agent behaviors with manageable agent/terrain interaction (movement limited by locations of landmasses).   Agent behaviors in this model will be simplified to movement factors, plus basic behaviors as pirates initiate attacks on cargo vessels.  The numbers of pirates are varied, but most behaviors kept constant.  The results show that increased pirate numbers can reduce the effectiveness of a security force, though the model also shows that some basic flaws in agent logic make the level of police force effectiveness difficult to understand. The primary goal of the model is to help form a basis for determining the number of patrol vessels needed to neutralize or at least reduce the piracy activities in the Malacca Straits."
