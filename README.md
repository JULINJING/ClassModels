# Sample of NetLogo Models

Within this project there are a collection of end of semester projects created by students from various classes I have given over the years. The purpose of this repository is to highlight how NetLogo can be used to explore a variety of social and environmental issues from the bottom up. 

These models come from a varity of end of semester projects from studnets who have took one of my classes over the years. Course descriptions and sample syllabi are available at <https://www.gisagents.org/p/teaching.html>

## Release Notes
Please note these models ***come as is***. Furthermore, no personal information is given on who created these models (unless there is a publication withit, but I need to acknowledge all the students who submitted the models, you know who you are! This project would not be possible without you!), What explanations there are given by the README file for each model (these mainly come in the form of abstracts from the papers that were submitted with the models). **No further explanations, support etc. will be given**. Lastly, these models are only given for pedagogical reasons and where possible each model has been upgraded to NetLogo 6.1.

## Model Categories
It needs to be noted that this is a very loose category list. For those interested models with (GIS) are ones which utilize GIS data.
