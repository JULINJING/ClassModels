# Sample of NetLogo Models from CSS 600 - Computational Social Science 

**Description**: This course is a graduate-level survey of computational approaches to social science research, with emphasis on methods, tools, software frameworks, and complexity theory as these apply to the investigation of social phenomena. For our purposes, "the social sciences" include anthropology, communication, economics and finance, geography, history, linguistics, political science, sociology, and social psychology, informed by developments in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and related branches of behavioral science.

Computational social science (CSS) is at the interdisciplinary frontier in the social sciences. As an introduction to the subject, the course has the following objectives:

1. To understand the motivation for the use of computational models in social science theory and research, including some historical aspects (Why conduct computational research in the social sciences?).
1. To learn about the variety of CSS research programs across the social science disciplines, through a survey of social simulation models (What has CSS accomplished thus far?).
1. To understand the distinct contribution that CSS can make by providing specific insights about society, social phenomena at multiple scales, and the nature of social complexity (What is the relation between computational social science.
1. To provide foundations for more advanced work in subsequent courses or projects for those students who already have or will develop a long-term interest in computational social science.

## Release Notes
Please note these models ***come as is***. Furthermore, no personal information is given on who created these models (unless there is a publication withit, but I need to acknowledge all the students who submitted the models, you know who you are! This project would not be possible without you!), What explanations there are given by the README file for each model (these mainly come in the form of abstracts from the papers that were submitted with the models). **No further explanations, support etc. will be given**. Lastly, these models are only given for pedagogical reasons and where possible each model has been upgraded to NetLogo 6.1.

For those interested, models with "***(GIS)***" next to them are ones which utilize GIS data.
