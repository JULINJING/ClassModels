# Private Conservation and Habitat Fragmentation


## Abstract

"Habitat loss and the accompanying loss of biodiversity is essentially a problem of land use. Here an agent-based model of land use and fragmentation is presented. Agents in the model are represented by patches. Agents choose between conserving habitat or destroying the habitat and producing a good sold in a perfectly competitive market."
