# Counterinsurgency Force Planning Ratio:  Analyzing The U.S. Military’s Published Minimum Force Planning Ratio For Coin Operations Through The Use Of An Agent-Based Model

## Abstract 

"The following paper presents an agent-based model focused on examining the U.S. military’s published minimum force planning ratio for counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.  The model attempts to replicate a simplified COIN environment in order to address whether the U.S. military’s published COIN ratio is sufficient for U.S. forces to achieve success."
