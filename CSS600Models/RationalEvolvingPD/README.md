# Emotionally-Rational Cognitive Agents


## Abstract

"This model is an evolutionary iterated spatial prisonerâ€™s dilemma. Agents can evolve emotional responses to events. They memorize something akin to the relative frequency or moving weighted average of their emotional responses to an event, but cannot yet determine temporal patterns or sequences of events."
