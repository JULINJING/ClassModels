# Modeling Emotions in Groups Using Agent-Based Models


## Abstract

"In this paper we consider an as yet unresolved question in the social sciences: how do emotions function in groups? While there is little consensus about how emotions work on even the individual level, we adapt several current theories to create an agent-based model. Using these emotional agents, with their simple behaviors, we consider how their behavior adapts in groups and according to two primary theories of group behavior."
